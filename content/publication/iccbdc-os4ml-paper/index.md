abstract: 'Recent AI research has significantly reduced the barriers to apply AI, but the process of setting up the necessary tools and frameworks can still be a challenge. While AI-as-a-Service platforms have emerged to simplify the training and deployment of AI models, they still fall short of achieving true democratization of AI. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by comparing several popular AI-as-a-Service platforms and identifying the key requirements for a platform that can achieve true democratization of AI. Our analysis highlights the need for self-hosting options, high scalability, and openness. To address these requirements, we propose our approach: the "Open Space for Machine Learning" platform. Our platform is built on cutting-edge technologies such as Kubernetes, Kubeflow Pipelines, and Ludwig, enabling us to overcome the challenges of democratizing AI. We argue that our approach is more comprehensive and effective in meeting the requirements of democratizing AI than existing AI-as-a-Service platforms.'
